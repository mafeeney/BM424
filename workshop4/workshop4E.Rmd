## Scenario E: Listeria in `r city_name`

The `r city_name` Pandemic Response committee has gathered the following information for the second meeting of your group. 

You should evaluate the effect(s) of the actions that you took at your last meeting and evaluate the current state of affairs in `r city_name`. 

You should submit 3-5 specific actions for further actions to control the pandemic, using the [workshop 4 pro forma](../proformas/BM424_workshop4_proforma.docx) (also available on MyPlace). You should consider whether you want to continue any of the public health measures you implemented at your previous meeting, or whether you want to stop them; and also whether there are any new, additional actions you would like to take. Submit the pro forma by noon on Friday March 24th, via the submission link on MyPlace. 

## Minutes from the last Pandemic Response Committee Meeting

Actions taken:

1. Food inspection in all restaurants, hospital, cafes, care homes, and schools. 

Ensuring that they follow GMP and GHP guidelines. Take samples in the hospitals or restaurants. 

2. Early diagnosis and contact tracing â€“ using whole genome sequencing to identify the food source. 

3. Enforcing extra protection in the maternity and ICU wards. 
-	Nurses or people working with food should wash hands.
-	Give special diet (fully cooked meals)
-	Possibly close vending machines for ready-to-eat foods in hospitals.


4. Sanitise food preparation areas (ex. kitchens) and vending machines in the hospital with chlorine. 

5. Avoid ready-to-eat cold food and educate public to heat their meals. 
-	Inform the public about the disease.
-	Urge for public to get in contact if they show symptoms.

<b>Subject:</b> This `r sample(adj1, 1)` Pandemic

Dear Pandemic Response Committee

I am so outraged by the food inspections you have mandated in all of the lovely restaurants in `r city_name`, it is like living in some nightmare of a country where you think that you can't trust anyone to be safe. What right do you have to impose these fascist measures on our fair city? The restaurants here have always had a very high safety record and are very good, I very much resent your implication that they are the source of this dreadful pandemic.

<b>Subject:</b> The state of the world

Dear Pandemic Response Committee,

I am so frightened about the foods that are available for sale in the hospital, I was in for an appointment and I seen also all the reports about how we should not eat anything that might be contaminated with Listeria. It feels like everything is so unsafe in the world now, for a while it was all the air we breathe was making us unsafe with the COVID virus and now it is the food that we are eating making us ill. Can you please just make sure people are safe again? 

Thank you so much for all the hard work you do,<br>

by `r sample(authname1, 1)` `r sample(surname1, 1)`

The `r dis_name4` pandemic ravaging `r city_name` has claimed yet another victim. There have been `r outbreak_deaths` deaths in the pandemic so far, but perhaps the most tragic loss is `r obit1name` `r obit1surname` - at only `r obit1age`, the youngest victim that the pandemic has claimed.    

`r obit1name` `r obit1surname` liked `r obit1like1` and `r obit1like2`. Friends and family say that `r pron1` was always `r sample(c("a delight", "an absolute joy", "a treasure", "the most precious child"), 1)`. 

`r obit1name` is survived by `r posspron1` parents and grandparents, and by `r posspron1` siblings `r obit1siblings`. 

The funeral service will be held `r sample(c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"), 1)` at `r sample(c("St. Ninian's", "Trinity Baptist Church", "Westlake Memorial", "St. Elfrida's Catholic Church", "St. Mary's", "Trinity Church", "St. Andrew's", "St. Judes"), 1)`.

The `r dis_name4` pandemic ravaging `r city_name` has claimed yet another victim. `r obit2name` `r obit2surname`, local `r obit2prof1` and star, sadly passed away on `r sample(c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"), 1)`. 

`r obit2name` was perhaps best known for `r posspron2` `r sample(2000:2015, 1)` work `r obit2work1` , but fans say that the rest of `r posspron2` work was equally as `r sample(c("memorable", "genre-changing", "excellent", "influential"), 1)`. 

`r obit2name` is survived by `r posspron2` `r sample(c("partner", "husband", "wife"), 1)`, and by `r posspron2` siblings `r obit2siblings`.

Citizens of `r city_name` should be `r sample(c("grateful", "thankful", "glad"), 1)` that the city's Pandemic Response Council, `r sample(c("swiftly", "quickly", "hurriedly"), 1)` convened when a new pandemic began to hit `r city_name`, has been so effective. While the initial death toll from the pandemic appeared to be quite `r sample(c("alarming", "devastating", "serious", "high", "heavy"), 1)`, the actions taken by the PRC seem to have been most effective. 

Officials from `r sample(c("the NHS", "Public Health Scotland", "the World Health Organisation", "the Center for Disease Control", "the Red Cross"), 1)` have publicly praised the `r city_name` PRC, saying that `r sample(c("it is difficult to imagine a more effective public health response", "their actions have been extremely effective", "the PRC has done all of the right things", "this is a triumph that shows how effective public health responses can be", "countless lives have been saved due to the actions of the PRC"), 1)`

There have been 6 deaths due to `r dis_name4` in `r city_name` this week. This is an enormous decrease, and hopefully `r city_name` will see the death toll continue to decrease in the coming weeks.

Governments across the globe have seen how successful power-grabs in the name of public health can be, following on the wave of restrictions imposed because of so-called viral diseases like COVID-19 and "mpox". So-called scientists are fearmongering - aerosols, monkeys, "bird" flu - now they think that they can fool us into thinking that the air and water are unsafe. Citizens of `r city_name` should stand strong against this terrible tyranny! No more mask mandates, no more senseless restrictions!

Our elders should not be left to die alone, left frightened and hopeless in a mandatory lockdown claimed to be "for their benefit." Our children should not be left to struggle through "pandemic" after "pandemic" - their language and literacy skills have been left behind due to these lockdowns, and their mental health is suffering. It is time that we take back control of our lives and end this tyranny of fear-mongering and so-called science. Citizens of `r city_name`, stand with me and resist this most recent attack on your freedoms and your lives.

Hard on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic and a number of other health scares (monkeypox, or "mpox", avian flu, and worries about other infectious disease outbreaks), another pandemic has hit the Scottish town of `r city_name`. This time, it's Listeria, a bacterium that is particularly fatal to the elderly and to pregnant women.

There have been `r outbreak_deaths` deaths in the pandemic so far, but perhaps the most frightening aspect to this new pandemic is rumours that these Listeria strains may have become resistant to even more antibiotics - a truly chilling possibility.

Scientists have been warning about the antibiotic resistance crisis for years, saying that careless use of antibiotics could mean that these precious medicines will no longer be available to us in the future. 

Some of the Listeria strains found in `r city_name` are reportedly resistant to all clinically available antibiotics, and scientists warn that these drug-resistant pathogens might be able to spread to new locations. Will nearby towns be next, or could these Listeria strains go as global as the SARS-COV2 virus did?
