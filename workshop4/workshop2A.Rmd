## Scenario A

`r dis_name1` outbreak in `r city_name`

The `r city_name` Pandemic Response committee has gathered the following information for the second meeting of your group. 

You should evaluate the effect(s) of the actions that you took at your last meeting and evaluate the current state of affairs in `r city_name`. 

You should submit 3-5 specific actions for further actions to control the pandemic, using the [workshop 4 pro forma](/proformas/BM424_workshop4_proforma.docx) (also available on MyPlace). You should consider whether you want to continue any of the public health measures you implemented at your previous meeting, or whether you want to stop them; and also whether there are any new, additional actions you would like to take. Submit the pro forma by noon on Friday March 24th, via the submission link on MyPlace.

The `r dis_name1` pandemic ravaging `r city_name` has claimed yet another victim. There have been `r outbreak_deaths` deaths in the pandemic so far, but perhaps the most tragic loss is `r obit1name` `r obit1surname` - at only `r obit1age`, the youngest victim that the pandemic has claimed.    

`r obit1name` `r obit1surname` liked `r obit1like1` and `r obit1like2`. Friends and family say that `r pron1` was always `r sample(c("a delight", "an absolute joy", "a treasure", "the most precious child"), 1)`. 

`r obit1name` is survived by `r posspron1` parents and grandparents, and by `r posspron1` siblings `r obit1siblings`. 

The funeral service will be held `r sample(c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"), 1)` at `r sample(c("St. Ninian's", "Trinity Baptist Church", "Westlake Memorial", "St. Elfrida's Catholic Church", "St. Mary's", "Trinity Church", "St. Andrew's", "St. Judes"), 1)`.

The `r dis_name1` pandemic ravaging `r city_name` has claimed yet another victim. `r obit2name` `r obit2surname`, local `r obit2prof1` and star, sadly passed away on `r sample(c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"), 1)`. 

`r obit2name` was perhaps best known for `r posspron2` `r sample(2000:2015, 1)` work `r obit2work1` , but fans say that the rest of `r posspron2` work was equally as `r sample(c("memorable", "genre-changing", "excellent", "influential"), 1)`. 

`r obit2name` is survived by `r posspron2` `r sample(c("partner", "husband", "wife"), 1)`, and by `r posspron2` siblings `r obit2siblings`.

Citizens of `r city_name` should be `r sample(c("grateful", "thankful", "glad"), 1)` that the city's Pandemic Response Council, `r sample(c("swiftly", "quickly", "hurriedly"), 1)` convened when a new pandemic began to hit `r city_name`, has been so effective. While the initial death toll from the pandemic appeared to be quite `r sample(c("alarming", "devastating", "serious", "high", "heavy"), 1)`, the actions taken by the PRC seem to have been most effective. 

Officials from `r sample(c("the NHS", "Public Health Scotland", "the World Health Organisation", "the Center for Disease Control", "the Red Cross"), 1)` have publicly praised the `r city_name` PRC, saying that `r sample(c("it is difficult to imagine a more effective public health response", "their actions have been extremely effective", "the PRC has done all of the right things", "this is a triumph that shows how effective public health responses can be", "countless lives have been saved due to the actions of the PRC"), 1)`

There have been 10 deaths due to `r dis_name1` in `r city_name` this week. This is an enormous decrease, and hopefully `r city_name` will see the death toll continue to decrease in the coming weeks.

Governments across the globe have seen how successful power-grabs in the name of public health can be, following on the wave of restrictions imposed because of so-called viral diseases like COVID-19 and "mpox". So-called scientists are fearmongering - aerosols, monkeys, "bird" flu - now they think that they can fool us into thinking that the air and water are unsafe. Citizens of `r city_name` should stand strong against this terrible tyranny! No more mask mandates, no more senseless restrictions!

Our elders should not be left to die alone, left frightened and hopeless in a mandatory lockdown claimed to be "for their benefit." Our children should not be left to struggle through "pandemic" after "pandemic" - their language and literacy skills have been left behind due to these lockdowns, and their mental health is suffering. It is time that we take back control of our lives and end this tyranny of fear-mongering and so-called science. Citizens of `r city_name`, stand with me and resist this most recent attack on your freedoms and your lives.

Hard on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic and a number of other health scares (monkeypox, or "mpox", avian flu, and worries about other infectious disease outbreaks), another pandemic has hit the Scottish town of `r city_name`. This time, it's `r dis_name1`, a bacterium that causes a sometimes fatal illness called Legionnaire's Disease.

There have been `r outbreak_deaths` deaths in the pandemic so far, but perhaps the most frightening aspect to this new pandemic is rumours that antibiotic-resistant <i>Legionella</i> have begun to emerge. 

Scientists have been warning about the antibiotic resistance crisis for years, saying that careless use of antibiotics could mean that these precious medicines will no longer be available to us in the future. 

Some of the <i>Legionella</i> found in `r city_name` are reportedly resistant to erythromycin, doxycycline, and moxifloxacin, and scientists warn that these drug-resistant pathogens might be able to spread to new locations. Will nearby towns be next, or could these <i>Legionella</i> go as global as the SARS-COV2 virus did?

## Investigation of water sources for <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>

Samples from each of the water sources were plated in triplicate on BCYE, PCV, and GPCV agar plates. Any candidate <i>Legionella</i> colonies were tested by multiplex PCR.

## Epidemiological questionnaire results

Patients with suspected or confirmed Legionnaire's Disease were contacted with an epidemiological survey regarding their recent movements. 60 survey forms were returned.
