## Scenario C

Disaster has struck - hard on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, another disease outbreak has hit your fair city, `r city_name`. Residents are outraged and worried. There have already been `r outbreak_deaths` deaths.

The cause of the outbreak appears to be methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA). (Please refer to the [CDC MRSA Fact Sheet](https://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/pdf/mrsa_consumerfactsheet_f.pdf) for more information about the pathogen.)

```{r MRSA, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="False-coloured scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of MRSA cells. Image credit: [CDC](https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=18127)"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/MRSA.jpg"))
```

Each member of your group will play one of the following roles as you attempt to tackle the disease outbreak and save your city:

1.	Provost (head of the city council)
2.	Representative from a national public health org. (Public Health Scotland)
3.	Epidemiologist (on secondment from Public Health Scotland)
4.	Director of the city's main hospital (`r hospital_name`)
5.	City planner/civil servant
6.	Microbiologist (working in one of the NHS Scotland clinical labs)
7.	Public communications expert (past and current sci comm campaigns)
8.  Doctor at a major surgery in `r city_name`
9.  Epidemiologist from the local university, an expert on <i>S. aureus</i> transmission

You must work together, using the information that has been provided for you in the attached information packets, and decide what action(s) should be taken to control the outbreak currently plaguing your city, `r city_name`. Your actions should be evidence-based – use the peer-reviewed literature to decide on measures that will stop the pandemic in your scenario.

Your action points may include directives to gather more information (e.g., contact tracing of current cases, microbiological testing of food/water, etc.), or specific directives (e.g. public health measures, non-pharmaceutical interventions, etc.). Use the data/expertise of all group members. Be clear, concise, and specific.

You may choose to include mathematical modeling as part of your decision making (for example, using an [epidemic calculator](http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html) or other models); if you do so, you should provide details of your modelling and predictions when you submit your group's pro forma.

You should submit 3-5 specific actions to control the pandemic, using the [workshop 3 pro forma](/proformas/BM424_workshop3_proforma.docx) (also available on MyPlace). Submit this by noon, Friday March 1st, via the submission link on MyPlace.

## Information Packet C3

You are an epidemiologist working for Public Health Scotland, sent to `r city_name` to help with the MRSA outbreak.

A team of scientists working together have in a PHS lab have isolated and cultured MRSA from a number of patient samples taken during this outbreak; isolated genomic DNA from cultures of these isolates; sequenced this DNA using an Illumina MiSeq platform; assembled the short paired-end reads; and compared these assemblies to the extant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> sequences available in the NCBI databases. The results of these experiments are summarised in the table below.

There are currently `r sample(143:180, size=1)` patients in the `r hospital_name` with confirmed or suspected MRSA, with `r sample(15:17, size=1)` of these patients currently in the ICU. 

The hospital follows the guidelines set out in the [National Infection Prevention and Control Manual](https://www.nipcm.hps.scot.nhs.uk/).

As a hospital director, you are familiar with the literature surrounding hospital pandemic preparedness, and regularly read papers such as:
