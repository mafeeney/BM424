```

## Scenario X

Disaster has struck - hard on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, another disease outbreak has hit your fair city, `r city_name`. Residents are outraged and worried. There have already been `r outbreak_deaths` deaths.

The cause of the outbreak appears to be DIS-NAME. (Please refer to the [WHO DIS-NAME Fact Sheet](add link here) for more information about the pathogen.)

```{r DISEASE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="as appropriate. Image credit: [CDC](link)"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/DIS-NAME.jpg"))
```

Each member of your group will play one of the following roles as you attempt to tackle the disease outbreak and save your city:

1.	Provost (head of the city council)
2.	Representative from a national public health org. (Public Health Scotland)
3.	Epidemiologist (on secondment from Public Health Scotland)
4.	Director of the city's main hospital (`r hospital_name`)
5.	City planner/civil servant
6.	Microbiologist (working in one of the NHS Scotland clinical labs)
7.	Public communications expert (past and current sci comm campaigns)
8.  Doctor at a major surgery in `r city_name`

You must work together, using the information that has been provided for you in the attached information packets, and decide what action(s) should be taken to control the measles outbreak currently plaguing your city, `r city_name`. Your actions should be evidence-based – use the peer-reviewed literature to decide on measures that will stop the pandemic in your scenario.

Your action points may include directives to gather more information (e.g., contact tracing of current cases, microbiological testing of food/water, etc.), or specific directives (e.g. public health measures, non-pharmaceutical interventions, etc.). Use the data/expertise of all group members. Be clear, concise, and specific.

You should submit 3-5 specific actions to control the pandemic, using the workshop 3 pro forma (available on MyPlace). Submit this by noon, Friday March 10th, via the submission link on MyPlace.

## Information Packet X1

You are the provost of `r city_name`, elected in `r sample(2012:2021, size=1)`.

You are a representative from Public Health Scotland, sent to `r city_name` to help with the DIS-NAME outbreak. 

Your briefing packet includes the following documents:

## Information Packet X3

You are an epidemiologist working for Public Health Scotland, sent to `r city_name` to help with the measles outbreak.

REPLACE THIS TEXT and TABLE - A team of scientists working together have in a PHS lab have isolated and cultured DIS-NAME virus (using a standard tissue culture model) from a number of patient samples taken during this outbreak; isolated DIS-NAME RNA from these cultures; reverse-transcribed this to DNA and sequenced this DNA using an Illumina MiSeq platform; assembled the short paired-end reads; and compared these assemblies to the extant DIS-NAME sequences available in the NCBI databases. The results of these experiments are summarised in the table below.
